**The reward function is fluid.** Max Xiong operates at the bleeding edge of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and predictive engineering. As an engineer at **Kalshi**, he navigates the regulated geometry of event contracts, while simultaneously pioneering subterranean RL frameworks like **PopStar**—systems designed to evolve beyond static objectives.

Through the **OpenEvolve** engine, he has effectively bridged the gap between raw compute and dynamic adaptability. He doesn't just train agents; he develops the infrastructure for agents to autonomously redefine their own success parameters.
